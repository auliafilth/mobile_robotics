Problem Set 1

Created on 2/2/2018 for Dr. Wyatt Newman's Mobile Robotics course at Case Western Reserve University.

This code should command the STDR to go to the top left corner. 

## Example usage

Use this command to open the STDR: 
'roslaunch stdr_launchers server_with_map_and_gui_plus_robot.launch'

Use this command to run my code: 
'rosrun my_stdr_control my_stdr_open_loop_commander'
